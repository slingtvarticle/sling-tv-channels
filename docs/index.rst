Choosing a streaming service today means looking beyond just cost—you want to know exactly what content you’ll get. For anyone considering cutting the cord, Sling TV channels play a huge role in the decision. Sling TV isn’t just affordable, it’s highly customizable, offering channel selections tailored to specific viewing preferences. But with so many options, understanding what Sling TV actually includes can be a bit confusing.

This guide is designed to give you a clear, human-friendly breakdown of the channel lineups, how they differ between packages, and how to build your perfect streaming experience with Sling.

How Do I Know What Channels Sling TV Offers?
Sling TV offers two main base packages: Sling Orange and Sling Blue. Each one comes with a unique set of channels, designed for different kinds of viewers. Sling Orange is known for family and sports content, while Sling Blue leans more toward news and general entertainment. You can also combine both into one package—Sling Orange & Blue—if you want the best of both.

With Sling Orange, you’ll find channels like ESPN, Disney Channel, Freeform, and CNN. It’s great for families, sports lovers, and those who enjoy lifestyle programming.

Sling Blue includes channels like FOX News, MSNBC, Discovery, FX, Bravo, and National Geographic. It also offers more flexibility with multiple streams, making it perfect for households where people watch different things at the same time.

Can I Customize My Sling TV Channels?
Yes, and this is where Sling truly stands out. After choosing your base package, you can personalize your lineup with add-on channel bundles. These bundles are grouped by category, such as Sports Extra, Kids Extra, Comedy Extra, News Extra, and Lifestyle Extra. Each one contains a mix of channels related to that theme.

For example, Sports Extra can give you access to NFL RedZone, NBA TV, NHL Network, and more. If you're a news junkie, the News Extra pack adds Bloomberg, BBC World News, and NewsNation.

You also have the option to add premium channels like Showtime, Starz, and AMC+, or explore international content with language-specific channel packs. All of this means your Sling TV channels can be as simple or as expansive as you want them to be.

Are Local Channels Available on Sling TV?
Sling TV offers limited access to local channels, and only in select markets. With the Sling Blue package, you may get FOX and NBC if they’re available in your region. Sling Orange doesn’t include local channels by default.

To help fill this gap, Sling recommends using an HD antenna, which allows you to watch local stations like ABC, CBS, and PBS over the air. Sling even offers device bundles that combine your antenna with the Sling interface using AirTV, giving you a seamless live TV experience.

What Sports Channels Are on Sling TV?
Sling Orange is the better option for sports fans, as it includes ESPN, ESPN2, and ESPN3. With the Sports Extra add-on, you can unlock even more sports coverage, including college sports networks and league-specific channels like SEC Network, NBA TV, and NHL Network.

Sling Blue includes NFL Network and FS1 by default, and also allows for Sports Extra upgrades. If you're a fan of all kinds of sports and don't want to miss a game, combining both base packages gives you the widest variety of sports content available on Sling.

What About Kids and Family Channels?
Sling TV channels for kids and families are available through both base packages, but Sling Orange has a slight edge thanks to Disney Channel and Disney Junior. You can also add the Kids Extra bundle, which includes popular channels like Nick Jr., Boomerang, BabyTV, and TeenNick.

This makes Sling a flexible option for families, as you can tailor your channel list to what your children actually watch without paying for content you don’t use.

Is Sling TV Right for My Channel Needs?
Whether Sling TV works for you depends on what you’re looking for. If you’re replacing cable and want all the major networks and sports channels, you’ll need to carefully choose your base package and add-ons. But if you want a more focused or budget-friendly channel lineup, Sling lets you pay only for what you want to watch.

It’s a great choice for people who don’t want to be locked into large bundles or long-term contracts. With Sling, you’re in control.
